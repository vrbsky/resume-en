This is a single-page resume for the tech industry (software engineers, data scientists, etc.). It uses the base latex templates and fonts to provide ease of use and installation when trying to update the resume. The different sections are documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting. The three main sections in the resume are education, experience, skills and projects.

The original template that served as a base for this version is available [here](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume).
